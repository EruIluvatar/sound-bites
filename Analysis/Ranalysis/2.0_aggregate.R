  # To investigate the in uence of auditory-induced arousal on RTs,

  # arousing stimulus for each participant. Similarly, S4 is the least arousing stimulus for 
  # each participant. RTs were analyzed using ANOVA with auditory-cue (S1 to S4), sound-location 
  # (frontal vs. rear), target-saliency, and target-location as within-subject factors.
